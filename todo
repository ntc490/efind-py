* Add ability to select directories or files
* Add ability to use variables
* Add abbrevs for commands
* Add curly brace expansion
* Add regular experssion handling for names
* Add flags like files=no, recurse=yes
* Change dir lists to comma separated values?  would help with space handling
* Use MIME type lists from http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/mime-types-full
* Create an interactive mode with completion on commands, directories and files
* Add 'diff' ability so only the additional files from a new command are added
  and no other paths are even walked.  Could do a similar thing on file removal?
  Think of the feature as 'incremental update'.
* List file_type filters
* Optimize filter defs to allow multiple levels for "at" and "include" clauses
* Add "anchor" tag that can be used to look for the start of a config
* Include other configs?
* Clone, template push and pull configs from a centralized "repo"
* Rotate/translate allows you to move config to a different directory level
* Copy configs by name and/or path
* Enable/disable configs at the same level?
* Merge configs?
* Ammend things from command line
* Pop into interactive mode?
* Inheritance up or down dir levels?
* Trigger pipe into other commands or source other commands
* Hooks: on-start, on-find-file, on-complete
* Create templates dir in home .efind directory.  Copy directories under that
  using the name of the root_dir so multiple 'default' configs can be stored
  as templates.
X Define default config
X Switch to docopt
X Add multiple dir levels after 'include' or 'exclude' commands
X Use .efind dir as a "repo" to contain current config.  Running efind causes it
  to look up the dir heirarchy until it finds a repo - then operate on
  subdirectories from there.
X Switch between different configurations


Repos:
* default config
* configs
* subcommands
* hooks
* pipes: input and output
* filters
