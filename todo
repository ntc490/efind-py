* Create an interactive mode with completion on commands, directories and files

  subdirectories from there.

* Copy configs by name and/or path
* Enable/disable configs at the same level?
* Merge configs?
* Ammend things from command line
* Pop into interactive mode?
* Inheritance up or down dir levels?
* Trigger pipe into other commands or source other commands
* Hooks: on-start, on-find-file, on-complete
