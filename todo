* Add ability to select directories or files
* Add ability to use variables
* [done] Add multiple dir levels after 'include' or 'exclude' commands
* Add abbrevs for commands
* Add curly brace expansion
* Add regular experssion handling for names
* Add flags like files=no, recurse=yes
* Change dir lists to comma separated values?  would help with space handling
* Use MIME type lists from http://reference.sitepoint.com/html/mime-types-full
* Create an interactive mode with completion on commands, directories and files
* Add 'diff' ability so only the additional files from a new command are added
